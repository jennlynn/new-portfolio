          Welcome to my portfolio! As a Frontend Engineer and UX Developer with almost 10 years of experience, I've had the privilege of working on two major e-commerce websites as well as several smaller projects. My skills in web design and development are combined with a passion for art, and I love to express my creativity through sketches and paintings.
